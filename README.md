## Installation
Install with [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/):
```shell
pip install -e git://github.com/briefmnews/marketing-blocks.git#egg=marketing_blocks
```

## Setup
In order to make `marketing-blocks` works, you'll need to follow the steps below.

### Settings
First you need to add the following configuration to your settings:
```python
INSTALLED_APPS = (
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',

    'marketing_blocks',
    ...
)
```
#### Optional
You can set a label to your marketing blocks with the following settings:
```python
MARKETING_BLOCKS_LABEL_CHOICES
```

Here is an exemple of usage:
```python
MARKETING_BLOCKS_LABEL_CHOICES = [("", "-----"), ("issue", "Issue"), ("panorama", "Panorama")]
```

You can add buttons in admin change_list and change_form with the following setting:
```python
MARKETING_BLOCKS_ADMIN_BUTTONS
```

Here is an exemple of usage:
```python
MARKETING_BLOCKS_ADMIN_BUTTONS = [
    (
        "<i class='icon-zoom-in icon-alpha75'></i> Preview Issue",
        f"{SITE_DOMAIN}/a/email/dernier/?marketing=true",
    ),
    (
        "<i class='icon-zoom-in icon-alpha75'></i> Preview Panorama",
        f"{SITE_DOMAIN}/panoramas/email/dernier/?marketing=true",
    ),
]
```

### Migrations
Next, you need to run the migrations in order to update your database schema.
```shell
python manage.py migrate
```

## Hot to use ?
In django-admin you can do to the app `Marketing_blocks` and create a new marketing bock.\
3 positions are available:
* **pre_header**: only one pre_header block can be active at the time.
* **header**: only one header block can be active at the time.
* **footer**: only one footer block can be active at the time.
* **pre_footer**: only one pre_footer block can be active at the time.
* **body_{1..10}**: you can set up to 10 body blocks.

Next you can retrieve all the active blocks like this:
```python
from marketing_blocks.models import MarketingBlock


def dummy_view(request):
    ...
    
    marketing_blocks = MarketingBlock.objects.get_active_block_for_position_and_label(label="issue")
    
    ...
```

## Tests

```shell
pip install -r test_requirements.txt
```
